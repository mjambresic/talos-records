    A small-scale prototype inspired by the 2014 game, The Talos Principle. It focuses on a recording mechanic and player interaction with the world, aiming to recapture the gameplay feel of the original game.

>[Interaction.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Interaction.h) ---
>[Interaction.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Interaction.cpp)  
>Handles basic player interaction with the world. Casts a line trace to detect objects available for interaction and manages interaction input.  

>[ItemHandle.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/ItemHandle.h) ---
>[ItemHandle.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/ItemHandle.cpp)  
>A scene component that picks up or puts down items. It handles interaction while items are in the player's hand and resolves placing or dropping them.

>[IInteractable.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/IInteractable.h)  
>An interface that defines basic interaction methods. Objects implementing this interface can interact with the player in a specific way.

</p>

>[RecordingStation.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/RecordingStation.h) ---
>[RecordingStation.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/RecordingStation.cpp)  
>A game object with three states: idle, recording, and playing. Depending on its state, it either saves snapshots of the current referenced recordable objects or resimulates the previously snapshot ones.

>[IRecordable.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/IRecordable.h)   
>An interface that allows objects to be referenced and participate in the recording system. It implements snapshotting and resimulation methods.

>[ItemSnapshot.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/ItemSnapshot.h), 
>[PlayerCharacterSnapshot.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/PlayerCharacterSnapshot.h), 
>[ItemPadSnapshot.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/ItemPadSnapshot.h)  
>Data structures designed to snapshot specific recordable objects.

<br>

## Puzzle
>[Puzzle.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Puzzle.h) ---
>[Puzzle.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Puzzle.cpp)  
>An actor component that references different pieces of a puzzle, tracking the completion of objectives and ensuring objects behave as a cohesive whole.

>[PuzzleGate.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/PuzzleGate.h) ---
>[PuzzleGate.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/PuzzleGate.cpp)  
>A game object that obstructs the player's way out of a puzzle. It has two states: open and closed, set based on objective completion.

>[IObjective.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/IObjective.h)  
>An interface that defines specific objectives for different puzzle objects.

<br>

## Other Game Objects & Player
>[Item.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Item.h) ---
>[Item.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Item.cpp)  
>Base class of an item that player can interact with and place into the world.  TODO rewrite


>[ItemPad.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/ItemPad.h) --- 
>[ItemPad.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Item.cpp)  
>Interactable object on which items can be placed, or taken from.  TODO rewrite

>[Terminal.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Terminal.h) ---
>[Terminal.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/Terminal.cpp)  
>Computer from which you access terminal.  TODO rewrite

>[PlayerCharacter.h](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/PlayerCharacter.h) ---
>[PlayerCharacter.cpp](TalosRecords/Source/TalosRecords/PlayerCharacter.cpp)  
>Player functionality.  TODO rewrite

<br>

## Blueprint functionality
>The Blueprints functionality included in this project primarily enhances the prototype's appearance and completeness, but is not necessarily designed for extensibility.  
  
>One example is the typewriting effect for the Terminal widget. Since Blueprints don't support delays, I recommend rewriting this functionality in C++ for better compatibility and to reduce repetitive code.
